# Lewis_C_TheGame
  I have created this game as part of my Software Architecture module while attending Salford University.
  I fell in love with Design Patterns when creating this game and will definitely continue to improve my
  understanding and knowledge about it, and the other areas within the module.
  Although the game runs slower than I would like, I am very proud of the progress I have made within my
  degree and I feel like this game expresses how willing I am to apply new information to a type of project
  I have never attempted before. I would also like to note the graphics and artwork was created by me using
  Adobe Illustrator and other similar products.
  [To Play: Use the WASD keys and avoid the correct enemy]
